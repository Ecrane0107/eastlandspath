Instructions:

1st Click = start node

2nd click = target/end node

All other clicks will spawn a black box/node that will act as a wall/barrier.

Space = Run

C = clear 

Right click will reset node to white/null.

If start or end is reset then the next click will spawn the corresponding node.


Code base was created from online tutorials, debugged myself.
